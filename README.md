# Graph Convolutional Network for Link Prediction

# Interactive Link

"http://127.0.0.1:5500/results/graph_visualization.html"

## Overview

This project implements a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** to perform **link prediction** on a social network graph. The objective is to learn node representations from graph structure and use them to predict missing or potential connections between nodes.

The implementation is designed to be modular, easy to understand, and fully reproducible, making it suitable for academic evaluation and practical learning of graph neural networks.

## Problem Description

In many real-world networks such as social networks, citation networks, and recommendation systems, not all relationships are explicitly known.  
The task of **link prediction** aims to determine whether a connection should exist between two nodes based on the observed graph structure.

In this project:

- Nodes represent users
- Edges represent relationships
- The goal is to predict missing edges using a GCN-based model

This problem is formulated as a **binary classification task on node pairs**.

## Dataset

The project uses **Zachary’s Karate Club** dataset, a well-known social network dataset frequently used in graph learning experiments.  
Its small size and clear structure make it ideal for demonstrating link prediction using Graph Neural Networks.

---

## Model Architecture

The model consists of the following components:

1. **GCN Encoder**

   - Two Graph Convolutional layers
   - ReLU activation
   - Outputs node embeddings

2. **Link Prediction Decoder**

   - Dot-product similarity between node embeddings
   - Produces a score for each candidate edge

3. **Loss Function**
   - Binary Cross Entropy with logits

---

## Training Procedure

- Graph edges are split into **training, validation, and test** sets
- Negative samples (non-existing edges) are generated automatically
- The model is trained using the Adam optimizer
- Training loss is monitored across epochs to ensure convergence

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The trained model is evaluated on the test set using:

- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **ROC-AUC**

The final evaluation results are saved in:
results/metrics.txt

---

## Visualization

Predicted links are visualized using **Plotly** and saved as an interactive HTML file:
results/graph_visualization.html

The visualization clearly distinguishes:

- Existing edges in the graph
- Predicted missing links generated by the model

This allows easy interpretation of model predictions.
